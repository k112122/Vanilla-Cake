Vanilla cake 

 

Pre-heat oven at 200ºC

1 cup all purpose flour

½ tsp baking powder

½ tsp baking soda

pinch of salt

Sift on newspaper and pour in mixing bowl

¾ cup sugar

½ cup milk powder

½ cup vegetable oil (its hard to get vegetable oil here so after lot of trials, I have figured out that Rice Bran oil works the best)

½ cup milk

1½ tbsp yogurt (¼ cup in full recipe)

⅔ tbsp vanilla essence (1 tsp in full)

Beat everything, remove lumps

Grease oven tray with oil and brush with flour

Place in oven for 10 minutes at 250ºC and then for another 40-45 minutes at 200ºC (temperatures vary for different ovens so it might take a few trials to figure out)
